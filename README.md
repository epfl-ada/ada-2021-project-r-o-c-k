# Datasets
* Quotebank data with unique quotes 2015-2020
* Provided Wikidata data with speaker information

## Data management
We use Google Collab to load and preprocess the raw Quotebank data because the dataset is very large. 
We access each line of the .bz2 and .parquet files using the methods provided in the examples.
Large compressed files (such as processed Quotebank data) are stored in the Google Drive. The .parquet files are also stored there for easy access.
